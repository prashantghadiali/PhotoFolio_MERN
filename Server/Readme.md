# server side code

I am using express and mongDB to understand fullstack concept.

open server folder in your terminal

$ npm i body-parser cors express mongoose

I assume that you installed nodemon globally. If it is not installed use $ npm i -g nodemon

$ nodemon index.js

your server is running
